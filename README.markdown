# Bumpspark

A modified copy of _why's `bumpspark' code, originally discussed and
collaborated on at [RedHanded] [1], built out a gem suitable for
inclusion in Rails projects (and standalone Ruby code).
  
This version of the library generates a transparent PNG.

Many thanks to the various collaborators:

* _why (concept, BMP implementation)
* jzp (png)
* MenTaLguY (transparency)

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
